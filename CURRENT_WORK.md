# CURRENT_WORK.md

## Right Now
v0.4.0 hardening complete; preparing for v1.0 release.

## Why
All core capabilities implemented (1,428 tests), cross-platform CI working - time to stabilize API and release.

## Next Step
Version bump to 1.0.0-rc1 and finalize CHANGELOG for release.

## Context When I Return
- v0.3.0: Capability gaps (stationarity, financial CV, 50+ metrics)
- v0.4.0: Hardening (benchmarks, Windows CI, reproducibility, property tests)
- Hub integration now complete
- ReadTheDocs deployment and PyPI test release remain for v1.0
