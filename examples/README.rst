Examples Gallery
================

21 real-world case studies demonstrating temporalcv's capabilities across
different domains and use cases.

Core Concepts (00-05)
---------------------
Foundational examples introducing validation gates, walk-forward CV,
statistical tests, persistence metrics, and conformal prediction.

Production Workflows (06-10)
----------------------------
Complete pipelines for real ML systems: financial CV with purging,
nested CV for hyperparameter tuning, regime stratification, multi-horizon
comparison, and end-to-end deployment.

Domain-Specific (11-15)
-----------------------
Industry-tailored examples: web traffic with seasonality, IoT sensors
with anomalies, macro GDP forecasting, energy load prediction, and
cryptocurrency with regime shifts.

Failure Cases (16-20)
---------------------
Learn from common mistakes: each shows what goes wrong and how the
validation gates catch the issue before it corrupts your results.
